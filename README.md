Welcome to the **Constants for Float64 Max Nth Factorial** repository! This project provides a simple way to understand the maximum value of the nth factorial when stored in double-precision floating-point format. If you're working with large numbers in JavaScript or Node.js, this repository will help you navigate the limits of floating-point representation.

## üìú Introduction

The factorial function grows rapidly, and when calculating large factorials, the results can exceed the maximum value representable in double-precision floating-point format. This repository helps you find the maximum nth factorial that can be accurately represented. The maximum value for a factorial in this format is essential for developers working in numerical computing, simulations, and data analysis.

## üöÄ Installation

To use this library, you can install it via npm. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install constants-float64-max-nth-factorial
```

## üîç Usage

Once installed, you can import the module in your JavaScript or Node.js application:

```javascript
const maxFactorial = require('constants-float64-max-nth-factorial');

// Get the maximum nth factorial
const maxN = maxFactorial.getMaxNthFactorial();
console.log(`The maximum nth factorial in Float64 is: ${maxN}`);
```

## üìä Examples

### Example 1: Finding the Maximum Factorial

```javascript
const maxFactorial = require('constants-float64-max-nth-factorial');

const maxN = maxFactorial.getMaxNthFactorial();
console.log(`Maximum nth factorial: ${maxN}`);
```

### Example 2: Using with Large Numbers

```javascript
const maxFactorial = require('constants-float64-max-nth-factorial');

for (let i = 0; i <= 20; i++) {
    console.log(`Factorial of ${i} is: ${maxFactorial.factorial(i)}`);
}
```

## üìö API Reference

### `getMaxNthFactorial()`

Returns the maximum value of n for which n! can be accurately represented in double-precision floating-point format.

### `factorial(n)`

Calculates the factorial of a given number n.
